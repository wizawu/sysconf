<p>This key is used to decode the data in your Firefox Sync account. You will need to enter the key each time you configure Firefox Sync on a new device.</p>

<div id="column1">
  <h2>Keep it secret</h2>
  <p>Your Firefox Sync account is encrypted to protect your privacy. Without this key, it would take years for anyone to decode your personal information. You are the only person who holds this key. This means you're the only one who can access your Firefox Sync data.</p>
</div>

<div id="column2">
  <h2>Keep it safe</h2>
  <p><em>Do not lose this key.</em> We don't keep a copy of your key (that wouldn't be keeping it secret!) so <em>we can't help you recover it</em> if it's lost. You'll need to use this key any time you connect a new device to Firefox Sync.</p>
</div>
